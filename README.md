# E-Commerce-BackEnd-ORM

## Description

This application was built for users to have a simple, easy way to keep track of and document their e-commerce website. This uses a mysql/sequelize database to store data based on the category, product and tag ids.

Users with coding experience as well as experience with sequelize can clone this repo and update the models to tailor this simple backend to their personal needs.

Had a study session with Brian Whisler, Nicholas Burr, Salvador Mejia, Jenae Luthi and Allison Kidd on 10/9. We talked generally about routing but I ended up getting this working on my own right before we met up.
